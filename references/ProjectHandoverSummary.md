## **Project Handover Summary \- Trap Tally**

**1\. Project Identification:**

* **1.1 Project Name:** Trap Tally  
* **1.2 Overall Goal:** To create a web application showcasing curated Spotify playlists (Monthly, Yearly, Artist "Best Of"), allowing users to browse artists/playlists and play songs via Spotify integration.

**2\. Progress Made in This Chat Session:**

* **2.1 Key Features/Components Completed:**  
  * Project foundation setup (Git, folders, basic files).  
  * Backend setup using NestJS, PostgreSQL (via Supabase), and Prisma.  
  * Database schema defined and migrated (Playlist, Artist, Song, CuratorToken, join tables).  
  * Backend API endpoints created for fetching artists (/api/artists, /api/artists/:id) and playlists by type (/api/playlists/yearly, /api/playlists/monthly, /api/playlists/artist) and songs within a playlist (/api/playlists/:id/songs).  
  * Backend curator authentication flow (/api/auth/spotify/login, /api/auth/spotify/callback) implemented to obtain and store Spotify API tokens in the database.  
  * Backend data sync logic (/api/sync/trigger) implemented to fetch data from configured Spotify playlists and populate the database, including calculating feature counts (monthly, yearly, best of).  
  * Frontend setup using React (Vite) and TypeScript.  
  * Frontend routing implemented for all main pages (Artists, Monthly, Yearly, Best Of, Artist Detail, Callback, Not Found).  
  * Frontend components created/adapted for Header, Filter Buttons, Year Selector, Month/Year Selector, Playlist Selector Card, Table Headers, Table Rows (Artist/Track).  
  * Frontend pages (Artists, Monthly Playlists, Yearly Playlists, Best Of Playlists, Artist Detail) implemented to fetch data from the backend API and display it, including basic filtering on the Artists page.  
  * Frontend client-side user authentication flow for Spotify playback initiated using Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.  
* **2.2 Significant Issues Resolved:**  
  * Corrected Spotify Redirect URI usage from localhost to 127.0.0.1.  
  * Resolved various Node.js/npm/npx execution errors related to Tailwind CSS initialization by reinstalling Node LTS and fixing PATH conflicts.  
  * Fixed backend dependency injection errors (AuthService in SyncModule, AuthService export).  
  * Fixed backend Prisma schema errors (CuratorToken import, nameOverride usage).  
  * Fixed frontend CORS errors by correctly configuring backend CORS policy via .env.  
  * Fixed frontend React import errors (useMemo).  
  * Corrected Spotify authentication URL construction.  
* **2.3 Core Decisions Made:**  
  * Architecture: Separate NestJS backend API and React (Vite) frontend SPA.  
  * Database: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, managed via Prisma ORM.  
  * Backend: NestJS framework.  
  * Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite build tool, Tailwind CSS for styling, Zustand for state management (setup but not heavily used yet), react-router-dom for routing, axios for API calls.  
  * Data Model: Hybrid approach storing curated structure and metadata locally, relying on Spotify for playback and initial data sync.  
  * Authentication: Backend uses OAuth Authorization Code flow for curator; Frontend uses Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for user playback authorization.

**3\. Current State of the Project/Code:**

* **3.1 Last Task Completed:** We were actively debugging the frontend client-side Spotify authentication flow (Authorization Code Flow with PKCE). The user is successfully redirected to Spotify for authorization, but upon redirecting back to the frontend callback URL (http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback), the browser displays a chrome-error://chromewebdata/ page, indicating it failed to load the callback resource. This happens even when using a simplified test version of the AuthCallback.tsx component that skips the token exchange step.  
* **3.2 Relevant File(s) or Module(s):**  
  * frontend/src/components/SpotifyAuthButton.tsx (initiates the PKCE flow)  
  * frontend/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx (handles the redirect back from Spotify \- currently using a simplified test version)  
  * frontend/.env (contains VITE\_REDIRECT\_URI)  
  * Spotify Developer Dashboard (Redirect URI configuration)  
* **3.3 Key Code Snippets/Configurations:** Please ask me to list the critical files/snippets needed for the next session. You will likely need to provide the current content of:  
  * frontend/src/components/SpotifyAuthButton.tsx  
  * frontend/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx (currently the simplified test version)  
  * frontend/.env (specifically VITE\_REDIRECT\_URI)  
  * Confirmation of the Redirect URIs registered in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

**4\. Next Steps & Immediate Goals:**

* **4.1 Primary Goal for the Next Chat:** Resolve the browser error (chrome-error://chromewebdata/) occurring during the redirect back from Spotify to the frontend /callback route in the PKCE user authentication flow.  
* **4.2 Specific Tasks to Start With:**  
  1. Re-verify the exact Redirect URI settings in the Spotify Developer Dashboard (http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback).  
  2. Investigate potential issues with the Vite development server or browser handling of the redirect to http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback.  
  3. Once the redirect works, restore the full token exchange logic in AuthCallback.tsx and debug any issues with the POST request to Spotify's token endpoint.  
* **4.3 Any Pending Questions or Open Points:** The root cause of the chrome-error://chromewebdata/ on the callback redirect needs to be identified.

**5\. Contextual Notes:**

* **5.1 Tools/Technologies Used:** Node.js (v22 LTS), npm, NestJS, TypeScript, React, Vite, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Supabase), Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Axios, spotify-web-api-node (backend), Spotify Web Playback SDK (frontend \- script loaded but not initialized), Postman (for API testing).  
* **5.2 Testing Notes:** Primarily manual testing in the browser and using Postman for backend endpoints so far. Need to implement automated testing (Unit, Integration, E2E) later.  
* **5.3 Deviations from Plan (if any):** Switched frontend user authentication from Implicit Grant to Authorization Code Flow with PKCE due to Spotify errors (unsupported\_response\_type).
